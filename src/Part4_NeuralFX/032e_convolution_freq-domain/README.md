# Frequency domain convolution example

This example does the following:

* load a signal from a wav file
* load an impulse response from a wav file
* convolve the signal with the impulse response in the frequency domain
* save the resulting proessed signal out to another wav file

It uses the Simple FFT library by Dmitry Ivanov which has an MIT license
It also uses the tinywave library by Martin Roth which has an open source license, provided in the folder with the library
