# Time domain convolution example

This example does the following:

* load a signal from a wav file
* load an impulse response from a wav file
* convolve the signal with the impulse response
* save the resulting proessed signal out to another wav file

It uses the tinywave library by Martin Roth which has an open source license, provided in the folder with the library
